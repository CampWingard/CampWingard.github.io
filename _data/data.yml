  title: Self-Assessment
  summary: |
    My greatest strengths revolve around programming, and my greatest weaknesses 
    revolve around communication. My career goals revolve around programming, thus 
    maximizing my strengths and hopefully minimizing my weaknesses. I have a lot 
    of general programming experience using various programming languages, but no 
    expertise unfortunately. In terms of collaborating in a team environment, I did 
    not experience programming with anyone else, but it is a constant with my current 
    job. My artifact enhancement does what I initially struggled with during the 
    original class, and much more that wasn't initially planned. The artifact uses 
    Android Studio, Java, and a SQLite database to accomplish everything I sought to 
    achieve through the enhancement.

      The artifact I selected for this project is the CS360 Inventory App. The 
      app was created using Android Studio around 2022-2023. The requirements 
      for the artifact were: a login requirement, the ability to add or subtract 
      products, a notification system to alert the user when a product is low, 
      and finally, all of the above should be accessed through different screens. 
      
      The main reason I selected this artifact was because there were no other 
      options available. That said, even if it wasn’t it would still be my top 
      pick. When originally creating it, I planned to do more than what was 
      required, and designed the UI around what I planned. In the end, I decided 
      to only do what was required since there was no reason for me to do otherwise. 
      With my Software Development enhancement, I planned to finish the buttons that 
      were previously unfinished. With the Algorithms and Data Structures enhancement, 
      I planned to add ways to filter through the data, such as name or storage. With 
      the Database enhancement, I planned to use a SQLite database to store the 
      accounts’ information. This would allow for the data to be saved between launches.
